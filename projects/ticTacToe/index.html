<p class="section">Dependencies</p>
<p>
This project was written in Java and compiled with JSE v1.4, so the appropriate
Runtime Environment is required.
</p>

<p class="section">Bugs & Thoughts</p>
<p>
For some reason, if I play the game as an applet, the sounds will often duplicate and there
will be two sounds heard after each play. This bug is not found when ran as an application.
(edit note 2010: 8 years later, the applet does not seem buggy anymore)
</p>

<p class="section">Credits</p>
<p>The game was coded by myself, David Lareau. Pictures were also took by me. 
I'd like to thank Random Joe for pausing his eternal game of Magic Number to play TicTacToe with us.</p>
