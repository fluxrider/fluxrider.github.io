Always in Style<br/>
<br/>
Blaster Master was too hard for me when I was young. As a full-grown adult I thought I would use Blaster Master Overdrive as some sort of late-bloomer rite of passage, but the first boss is quite the challenge. I love it!<br/>

Answer from the editor:<br/>I am <i>loving</i> the return of all these retro games and franchises on WiiWare. Blaster Master Overdrive, Megaman 9 and 10, Sonic 4, Contra, Gradius, and Castlevania ReBirth&mdash;what a great time for fans of the classics!

Q. What do you think of Wii Sports Resort and Wii MotionPlus?<br/>
<br/>
A. The Wii MotionPlus accessory adds new possibilities, but does not resolve much of the imprecision that is common to all motion-controlled games. My favorite Wii titles are still the button-based ones such as Mega Man 9, Punch-Out!!, and Fire Emblem. Nothing beats the tried and true, 100-percent-precise buttons.<br/>
