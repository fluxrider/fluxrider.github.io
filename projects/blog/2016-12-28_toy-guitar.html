<p class="A">
It's Christmas time, and my daughter likes to play with her new toy guitar. My problem is that it's way too loud.
I'm not an electrical engineer, but I figure it should be quieter if I add a resistor to the circuit.
No worries, it was picked up in a second hand store.

<p>MEASURING DECIBELS</p>
<p>
Lacking any fancy instruments to measure the decibel output from the toy guitar,
I chose to use a random decibel reading app on my android device.
</p>
<p>
The app I installed is <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bosch.nvh_analysis&hl=en">iNVH from Robert Bosch Engineering &amp; Business Solutions(P) Ltd</a>. In retrospect, any sensor reading app will give your decibels reading. My favorite is called <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fivasim.androsensor">AndroSensor</a>.

Choosing a resistor was the hardest part. Most random resistors from my bag either did not reduce the decibel output, or cut the sound completely.
Unable to become proficient at reading the color codes (gold VS yellow!), I tested resistors on a cheap analog voltmeter/ammeter/ohmmeter until I found something that looked liked 10 Ohm.

I'm happy with the results, but there is one issue. The guitar already had a 3 states volume knob.
I don't know why, but after my changes, what use to be the quietest is now the loudest.
When I set it on what use to be the loudest, it now sounds crackled (but has very low volume).
The medium setting is the best now in terms or most quiet yet not buggy.
